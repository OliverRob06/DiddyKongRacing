                            Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct 2, in which a team
                            was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for 
                            that console. During development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon
                            evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no 
                            involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro-Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to 
                            the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Lee Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured
                            three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.

                            With Banjo-Kazooie being delayed until the summer of 1998, the team was adamant for a 
                            release of an AAA video game in time for 1997's Christmas season. After successfully demoing 
                            the game to Shigeru Miyamoto, he felt that Pro Am 64 did not have a strong enough intellectual 
                            property to capture the attention of consumers, and suggested rebranding the game around
                            a widely-recognized Nintendo character, and thus Rare changed the licence to feature 
                            Diddy Kong. According to Lee Musgrave, the decision to choose Diddy Kong rather than 
                            Donkey Kong was based on their own choice, a decision which Nintendo "enjoyed". 
                            Once the intellectual property was changed, the team were left to adapt the visual 
                            aesthetics of the game and packaging before it could be released. Musgrave 
                            recalled that the ultimate goal of the game was to make it "run as fast" as Mario Kart 64, 
                            which proved difficult during development as the latter game utilised 2D character sprites
                            whereas Diddy Kong Racing used fully 3D models. Musgrave later attributed the success
                            of the overall project due to the "small team" of 14 people who worked on it. 
                            In an October 2012 interview, Musgrave said that Timber the Tiger would have been
                            the main character of Pro Am 64 had the intellectual property for Diddy Kong Racing 
                            not been conceived. Two of the characters who featured in Diddy Kong Racing,
                            Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel, starred in games (Banjo-Kazooie and Conker's 
                            Bad Fur Day, respectively) which were unveiled to the public before Diddy Kong Racing,
                            at the June 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), but ultimately not released until 
                            after Diddy Kong Racing. Rare stated that they chose not to exhibit Diddy Kong 
                            Racing at E3 because of the proprietary animation technology used in the game.

                            The game's soundtrack was composed by David Wise. The soundtrack was first 
                            released in Japan on 1 April 1998, with 42 tracks, while a version of the 
                            album was released in Europe with the same number of tracks. For its United 
                            States release only 16 tracks were featured. The disc itself was specially shaped 
                            in the form of Diddy Kong's head, which was unplayable in certain CD players. 
                            The sound effects were created by Graeme Norgate. Voices were provided by Kevin 
                            Bayliss (Bubbler, Wizpig), Johnni Christensen (Tiptup, Smokey), 
                            Eveline Novakovic (Pipsy), Keith Rabbette (Bluey), Lee Ray (Drumstick, Taj),

                                        Nintendo enjoyed the fact that we chose Diddy Kong over Donkey Kong; 
                                        I think that it was us trying to build on the fact that Diddy was ours,

                                        Due to most of the Nintendo 64's planned 1997 Christmas season line-up 
                                        being delayed until 1998, Diddy Kong Racing became the main Nintendo 64 
                                        release for the holiday shopping season, and a majority of Nintendo's 
                                        $200 million advertising budget for the entire year was allocated to 
                                        promoting the game. The game had a $20 million marketing budget in 
                                        North America. Diddy Kong Racing also held the distinction of being the 
                                        only game in the North American Christmas season line-up for which development 
                                        was contracted by Nintendo; the other two first-party Nintendo 64 games 
                                        in the line-up, Bomberman 64 and Mischief Makers, were both licensed 
                                        from Japanese third-party publishers.

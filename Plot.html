                                    In Diddy Kong Racing, players can choose one of ten characters, 
                                    who have access to three different vehicles: car, hovercraft, and 
                                    aeroplane. The car is an all-round vehicle, but it is the slowest on 
                                    certain surfaces like sand and water. The hovercraft is designed for 
                                    both sand and water areas, but lacks in acceleration and manoeuvrability. 
                                    The aeroplane is designed to access aerial areas; it is good at 
                                    acceleration and manoeuvring, but has the slowest speed.

                                        has a set of boosters known as "zippers" that temporarily boost the 
                                        player's speed, as well as featuring regenerating balloons of various 
                                        colours that provide power-ups.
                                        There are five different types of 
                                        balloons: red, blue, green, yellow, and rainbow. Red balloons grant 
                                        missiles to attack racers ahead, blue balloons grant a speed boost, 
                                        yellow balloons grant shields to protect the player from attacks, 
                                        green balloons grant deployable traps to delay other racers, and 
                                        rainbow balloons grant a magnet ability that brings the player closer 
                                        to the nearest racer. If multiple balloons of the same colour are 
                                        picked up, the power-up is upgraded to a more powerful version. A total 
                                        of two upgrades are available for each balloon.

                                    contain non-regenerating bananas that add to speed when they are picked up. 
                                    A maximum of ten bananas will improve the speed, but can also be obtained 
                                    to prevent other players from gaining speed. If a racer gets hit, two bananas are deducted.

                                is unlocked after defeating Wizpig for the first time and ranking 
                                first place in all four Trophy Races of the original worlds. 
                                Each world contains four racetracks, an unlockable battle stage, 
                                and a race against a boss character. If the player defeats Wizpig 
                                in Future Fun Land, obtains all amulet pieces, and collects all the 
                                gold medals, the player will be able to play in a mode called 
                                "Adventure 2". In this mode, all the balloons change colour to 
                                platinum, and the tracks are inverted from left to right.

                                also features four battle modes which consist of two deathmatch maps, 
                                a capture-the-flag-style battle, and a mode which involves opponents 
                                capturing eggs. The battle modes are not initially selectable and must

                                        Their enjoyment is interrupted when a sinister intergalactic 
                                        pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber's Island and attempts to 
                                        take it over after having conquered his own planet. He turns the island's 
                                        four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, Bluey the Walrus, Bubbler the Octopus, 
                                        and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the 
                                        island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races 
                                        that involve cars, hovercraft, and aeroplanes. Drumstick the Rooster, 
                                        the best racer on the island, fails this challenge and is 
                                        transformed into a frog by Wizpig's magic.

                                        confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterward,

                                        planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to 
                                        invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a 
                                        second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides 
                                        on malfunctions and launches him to the moon. However, an additional 
                                        cutscene reveals Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky, unscathed.
